MooTools-Cursor-Loader is a quick addon tool that can be used as a loading icon whenever an action is performed and requires a loading animation which the user is aware of.

The loading icon follows the mouse and can be used as follows:

CursorLoader.init({ ... });

CursorLoader.reveal(); (or CursorLoader.show() for a non-animated reveal)

CursorLoader.dissolve(); (or CursorLoader.hide() for a non-animate dissolve)

CursorLoader.destroy(); (if you want to remove the object entirely)
