MooTools-Cursor-Loader is a quick addon tool that can be used as a loading icon whenever an action is performed and requires a loading animation which the user is aware of.

The loading icon follows the mouse and can be used as follows:

CursorLoader.init(); //Get it ready

CursorLoader.show();

CursorLoader.hide();
